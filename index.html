        <h3>UI/UX Engineer</h3>
        <p>My name is Sayma Yadnin, and I live in Dhaka, Mohammadpur. I have a degree in CSE from ULAB. Currently, I work as a UI/UX Engineer at CMED Health Limited, where I've been designing intuitive interfaces for mobile and web dashboards for four years. My experience includes leading the redesign of our flagship health monitoring app, which resulted in a 30% increase in user engagement. In my free time, I love cooking and crafting. I'm currently enhancing my front-end development skills to complement my design expertise, with the long-term goal of leading my career in both design and development. I'm always eager to learn new things and love being around creative people.</p>
